/**
 * Cricket 24 â€¢ Shared Types (JSON-only build)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Purpose:
 * - Provide strict, centralized type unions for delivery taxonomy,
 *   lengths, lines, phases, and pitch types in Cricket 24 terms.
 * - Keep the Bowler model independent from any CSV/roster shape;
 *   lib/jsonLoader.ts adapts raw JSON -> Bowler.
 * - Used by strategyMap, deliveryLogic, and overLogic to build
 *   strengths-based, trap-oriented, unique wicket plans.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - PitchType uses "Dry" (NOT "Flat"), per requirements.
 * - Downstream logic treats `purpose` as human-readable trap intent.
